Nussknacker lets you design, deploy and monitor processes using GUI. You can run your processes on various engines. 

Nussknacker started as Apache Flink "self-service" process authoring tool. We still leverage the power, performance and reliability of Apache Flink to make your streaming processes fast and accurate. 

But you are not limited to Flink. The request-response engine lets you create processes exposing REST API.
